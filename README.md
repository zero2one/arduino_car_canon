# Car vs Canon

This is an Arduino project where a car drives to place on a grid
and the canon shoots a ball into the collection tray on top of the car.

The project contains 2 arduino's:

* One to controll the car.
* One to controll the canon.

## Car

The car uses:

* One [Adafruit Motor Shield v2.3] to controll the wheels.
* The compass sensor from the [Adafruit LSM9DS1 board] to get the heading.
* One [Adafruit Ultrasone sensor] to measure distance.
* One [Adafruit 128x32 OLED display].
* Two motors and wheels from the [Velleman 2 wheel drive chassis].
